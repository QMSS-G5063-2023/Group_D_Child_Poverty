# Project description
This study aims to understand the temporal trends in the child poverty rate and the role of governmental efforts in reducing poverty. We ask three research questions:
1. How has the child poverty rate changed over time between 1968 and 2020? Does the trend differ between families with and without children?
2. How much each government program reduced child poverty rate? Is there difference between 1968 and 2020?
3. How does the child poverty reduction effects differ geographically across states?

To address the research questions, we begin with plotting the poverty rate over time, by family types. We examine whether poverty rate dynamically change along welfare reform, economic recessions, and public health crises. We then calculate how much each anti-poverty policy contributed to reducing child poverty rate in 1968 and 2020. This allows us to explore the role of public policies in reducing child poverty and to analyze whether the influence of each anti-poverty tools have changed between 1968 and 2020. Finally, we map the geographical variation across states in their poverty reduction effects using choropleth map. We visually compare how much each state acheived poverty reduction through public policies.

Data

Our poverty estimates rely on two sources of data. For the historical trend of child poverty rate from 1968 to 2020, we used Historical Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) Data from the Center on Policy and Social Policy at Columbia University. It is an individual-level data that offers one's poverty status and the information on the amount of income resources from various government benefits. We limited our analysis to children under the age of 18. More information on historical SPM data is available at https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/historical-spm-data. 

The second data source is from the 2022 Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC), which collects all data necessary to estimate the 2021 poverty rates under both OPM and SPM. All data are downloaded from the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS-CPS, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org; Flood et al., 2022).
