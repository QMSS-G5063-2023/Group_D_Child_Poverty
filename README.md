# Project description
This study aims to understand the temporal trends in the child poverty rate and the role of governmental efforts in reducing poverty by asking three research questions:
1. How has the child poverty rate changed between 1968 and 2020? Does the trend differ between families with and without children?
2. How much public transfers reduce child poverty rate?
3. How does the child poverty reduction effects differ by states?

To address the research questions, we begin with plotting the poverty rate over time, by family types. We then calculate how much each anti-poverty policy contributed to reducing child poverty rate in 1968 and 2020. Finally, we map the geographical variation across states using po

Our poverty estimates rely on two sources of data. For the historical trend of child poverty rate from 1968 to 2020, we used Historical Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) Data from the Center on Policy and Social Policy at Columbia University. It is an individual-level data that offers one's poverty status and the information on the amount of income resources from various government benefits. We limited our analysis to children under the age of 18. More information on historical SPM data is available at https://www.povertycenter.columbia.edu/historical-spm-data. 

The second data source is from the 2022 Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey (CPS-ASEC), which collects all data necessary to estimate the 2021 poverty rates under both OPM and SPM. All data are downloaded from the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS-CPS, University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org; Flood et al., 2022).
