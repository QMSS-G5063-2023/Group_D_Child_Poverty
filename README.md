# Project description
Child poverty in the United States
This study aims to understand the temporal trends in the child poverty rate and the role of governmental efforts in reducing poverty by asking three research questions:
1. How has the child poverty rate changed between 1968 and 2020? Does the trend differ between families with and without children?
2. How much public transfers reduce child poverty rate?
3. How does the child poverty reduction effects differ by states?
